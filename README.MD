# MixinExtras

A small companion library to [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/), designed to help you write your Mixins in
a more expressive and compatible way.

More information about each feature offered can be found at the [Wiki](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras/wiki).

## Setup
For the time being, I recommend depending on this library via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).
After adding its repository to your build script, you can depend on it like so 
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.LlamaLad7:MixinExtras:0.0.1")
}
```
